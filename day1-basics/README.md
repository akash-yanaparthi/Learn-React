This is our first React App we have create using Vite
//clone this repo before moving further
install the node modules before running the project 
cmd- npm install (or) npm i 

Before you could enter into working with the project created, Go through the directory structure and also get to know what is the work of each file 

"src" folder 
Contains all the files, we are working with. The src (source) folder is where all your React code lives. It contains the main files for your app, including components, styles, and logic.

" package.json " folder 
It is like a summary file for your project. It contains:
✅ Project information (name, version, description)
✅ Dependencies (libraries used in the project)
✅ Scripts (commands to run your app)



So when you are creating new components, it is always recommended that you use the naming convention that is, starting letter of the component name should be a capital letter.
